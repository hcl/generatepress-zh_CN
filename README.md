# generatepress-zh_CN
Simplified Chinese translation files for [GeneratePress WordPress theme](https://github.com/tomusborne/generatepress).

## Usage
Put generatepress-zh_CN.po and generatepress-zh_CN.mo under `/wp-content/languages/themes/`ã€‚

## Note
1. Translation was based on the message.pot which was generated from the source code.
2. For some unknown reason, it seems to be failed when putting the .po and .mo files under the `languages` folder in the theme root folder.

## License
The traslation was licensed under GNU GPLv2.
